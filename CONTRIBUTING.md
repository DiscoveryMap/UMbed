# Contributing to UMbed

We're glad you found the UMbed project! We hope this project helps make your life a little easier and greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in improving it.

We are a small company with a small development team and we understand all too well how much we rely upon--and have benefited from--the open source community. We try to pay it forward whenever we can, whether that's providing bug reports, submitting code & documentation fixes, or publishing projects such as this one. We couldn't do it without you! 

## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

If you've found an issue with the code or documentation, start by reviewing the [issues](issues) & [pull requests](pulls) to see if anyone has already reported the problem. If they have, join in on the discussion of said issue and feel free to provide your own pull request.

If there is not an existing issue or pull request:

* If the required changes are minor (fixing a typo or the like), you're welcome to just submit a pull request
* If the required changes are major or you don't have a solution yet, create an issue first, then submit a pull request for it (if you have a solution)

### Making Changes

You will need to do the following to make changes that are most likely to be accepted with little headache and back & forth:

1. Fork the project on GitHub.
2. Create a topic branch from the master branch.
3. Make commits in logical units and with properly explanatory commit messages.
4. Add tests to validate any functional changes (if applicable).
5. Run all tests to confirm that nothing else broke.

### Submitting Changes

When you've completed your changes and are ready for them to be merged into the main project, you can do the following to submit them for review and likely inclusion:

1. Push your changes to your fork of the project on GitHub
2. Submit a pull request to the main project, noting the issue number which it relates to (if applicable)
3. That's all there is to it. If you followed the [Making Changes](#making-changes) guidelines and the changes are aligned with the project's vision & roadmap, it should be a pretty smooth process to get them merged in.
